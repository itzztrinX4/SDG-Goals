            Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
        </h1>
        <br>
        <h3>The <b>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</b> are also known as <b>Global Goals.</b> They were adopted   by all United Nations Member States in 2015 to set a goal to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy prosperity and peace by <b>2030.</b>
            
            The 17 SDGs are integratedâ€”they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.

            Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.
            
            The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context.</h3>
