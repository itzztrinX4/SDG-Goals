    <h2>The SDGs can only be realized with strong global partnerships and cooperation. Official Development Assistance
        remained steady but below target, at US$147 billion in 2017. While humanitarian crises brought on by conflict or
        natural disasters continue to demand more financial resources and aid. Many countries also require Official
        Development Assistance to encourage growth and trade.
        <br><br>
        The world is more interconnected than ever. Improving access to technology and knowledge is an important way to
        share ideas and foster innovation. Coordinating policies to help developing countries manage their debt, as well
        as promoting investment for the least developed, is vital for sustainable growth and development.
        <br><br>
        The goals aim to enhance North-South and South-South cooperation by supporting national plans to achieve all the
        targets. Promoting international trade, and helping developing countries increase their exports is all part of
        achieving a universal rules-based and equitable trading system that is fair and open and benefits all.

            to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection</li>
        <li>Developed countries to implement fully their official development assistance commitments, including the
            commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of ODA/GNI to developing
            countries and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries ODA providers are encouraged to
            consider setting a target to provide at least 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries</li>
        <li>Mobilize additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources</li>
        <li>Assist developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at
            fostering debt financing, debt relief and debt restructuring, as appropriate, and address the external debt
            of highly indebted poor countries to reduce debt distress</li>
        <li>Adopt and implement investment promotion regimes for least developed countries</li>
        <li>Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and

        Technology
    <ul>
        <li>Enhance North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation on and access to
            science, technology and innovation and enhance knowledge sharing on mutually agreed terms, including through

            global technology facilitation mechanism</li>
        <li>Promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to
            developing countries on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually
            agreed</li>
        <li>Fully operationalize the technology bank and science, technology and innovation capacity-building mechanism
            for least developed countries by 2017 and enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information
            and communications technology</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Capacity Building
    <ul>

        <li>Realize timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis for all least
            developed countries, consistent with World Trade Organization decisions, including by ensuring that
