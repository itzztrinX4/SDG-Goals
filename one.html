    <h2>Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of
        people living in extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015, too many are still struggling
        for the most basic human needs.
        <br><br>
        As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90 a day; many lack food, clean drinking
        water and sanitation. Rapid growth in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty, but
        progress has been uneven. Women are more likely to be poor than men because they have less paid work, education,
        and own less property.
        <br><br>
        Progress has also been limited in other regions, such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80
        percent of those living in extreme poverty. New threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food
        insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of poverty.
        <br><br>
        The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started, and end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030.
        This involves targeting the most vulnerable, increasing basic resources and services, and supporting communities
        affected by conflict and climate-related disasters.

    <p>
        Goal Targets -
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty
                in all its dimensions according to national definitions</li>
            <li>Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and
                by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable</li>
            <li>By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to
                economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms
                of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services,
                including microfinance</li>
            <li>By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure
                and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks
                and disasters</li>
            <li>Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced
                development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in
                particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its
                dimensions</li>
            <li>Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions
                </li>
        </ul>
