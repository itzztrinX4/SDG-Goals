    <h2>Ending all discrimination against women and girls is not only a basic human right, it’s crucial for sustainable
        future; it’s proven that empowering women and girls helps economic growth and development.
        <br><br>
        UNDP has made gender equality central to its work and we’ve seen remarkable progress in the past 20 years. There
        are more girls in school now compared to 15 years ago, and most regions have reached gender parity in primary
        education.
        But although there are more women than ever in the labour market, there are still large inequalities in some
        regions, with women systematically denied the same work rights as men. Sexual violence and exploitation, the
        unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work, and discrimination in public office all remain huge barriers.
        Climate change and disasters continue to have a disproportionate effect on women and children, as do conflict
        and migration.
        <br><br>
        It is vital to give women equal rights land and property, sexual and reproductive health, and to technology and
        the internet. Today there are more women in public office than ever before, but encouraging more women leaders
        will help achieve greater gender equality.
