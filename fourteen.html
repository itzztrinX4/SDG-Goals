    <h2>The world’s oceans – their temperature, chemistry, currents and life – drive global systems that make the Earth
        habitable for humankind. How we manage this vital resource is essential for humanity as a whole, and to
        counterbalance the effects of climate change.
        <br><br>
        Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. However, today we are
        seeing 30 percent of the world’s fish stocks overexploited, reaching below the level at which they can produce
        sustainable yields.
        <br><br>
        Oceans also absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, and we are seeing a 26 percent
        rise in ocean acidification since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Marine pollution, an overwhelming
        majority of which comes from land-based sources, is reaching alarming levels, with an average of 13,000 pieces
        of plastic litter to be found on every square kilometre of ocean.
        <br><br>
        The SDGs aim to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from pollution, as well as address
        the impacts of ocean acidification. Enhancing conservation and the sustainable use of ocean-based resources
        through international law will also help mitigate some of the challenges facing our oceans.

        Goal Targets -
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based
            activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution</li>
        <li>By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts,
            including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve
            healthy and productive oceans</li>
        <li>Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation
            at all levels</li>
        <li>By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
            and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish
            stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as
            determined by their biological characteristics</li>
        <li>By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and
            international law and based on the best available scientific information</li>
        <li>By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing,
            eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from
            introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential
            treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade
            Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation
        </li>
        <li>By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries from
            the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture
            and tourism</li>
        <li>Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account
            the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology,
            in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development
            of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries</li>
        <li>Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets</li>
        <li>Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law
            as reflected in UNCLOS, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of
            oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of The Future We Want</li>
    </ul>
