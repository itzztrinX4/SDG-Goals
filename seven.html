    <h2>Between 2000 and 2018, the number of people with electricity increased from 78 to 90 percent, and the numbers
        without electricity dipped to 789 million.
        <br><br>
        Yet as the population continues to grow, so will the demand for cheap energy, and an economy reliant on fossil
        fuels is creating drastic changes to our climate.
        <br><br>
        Investing in solar, wind and thermal power, improving energy productivity, and ensuring energy for all is vital
        if we are to achieve SDG 7 by 2030.
        <br><br>
        Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean and more efficient energy in all countries
        will encourage growth and help the environment.
