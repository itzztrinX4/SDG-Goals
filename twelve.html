    <h2>Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological footprint
        by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Agriculture is the biggest user of water
        worldwide, and irrigation now claims close to 70 percent of all freshwater for human use.
        <br><br>
        The efficient management of our shared natural resources, and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants,
        are important targets to achieve this goal. Encouraging industries, businesses and consumers to recycle and
        reduce waste is equally important, as is supporting developing countries to move towards more sustainable
        patterns of consumption by 2030..
        <br><br>
        A large share of the world population is still consuming far too little to meet even their basic needs. Halving
        the per capita of global food waste at the retailer and consumer levels is also important for creating more
        efficient production and supply chains. This can help with food security, and shift us towards a more resource
        efficient economy.

        Goal Targets -
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries
            taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and
            capabilities of developing countries</li>
        <li>By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources</li>
        <li>By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along
            production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses</li>
        <li>By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life
            cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air,
            water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment</li>
        <li>By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse</li>
        <li>Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to
            integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle
        </li>
        <li>Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and
            priorities</li>
        <li>By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable
            development and lifestyles in harmony with nature</li>
        <li>Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more
            sustainable patterns of consumption and production</li>
        <li>Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates
            jobs and promotes local culture and products</li>
        <li>Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market
            distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out
            those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account
            the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on
            their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities</li>
    </ul>
