    <h2>More than half of us live in cities. By 2050, two-thirds of all humanity—6.5 billion people—will be urban.
        Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our
        urban spaces.
        <br><br>
        The rapid growth of cities—a result of rising populations and increasing migration—has led to a boom in
        mega-cities, especially in the developing world, and slums are becoming a more significant feature of urban
        life.
        <br><br>
        Making cities sustainable means creating career and business opportunities, safe and affordable housing, and
        building resilient societies and economies. It involves investment in public transport, creating green public
        spaces, and improving urban planning and management in participatory and inclusive ways.
