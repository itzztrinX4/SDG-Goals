    <h2>Investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over
        half the world population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more
        important, as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies.
        <br><br>
        Technological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges,
        such as providing new jobs and promoting energy efficiency. Promoting sustainable industries, and investing in
        scientific research and innovation, are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development.
        <br><br>
        More than 4 billion people still do not have access to the Internet, and 90 percent are from the developing
        world. Bridging this digital divide is crucial to ensure equal access to information and knowledge, as well as
        foster innovation and entrepreneurship.
