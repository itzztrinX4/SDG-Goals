    <h2>There is no country that is not experiencing the drastic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions are
        more than 50 percent higher than in 1990. Global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system,
        which threatens irreversible consequences if we do not act.
        <br><br>
        The annual average economic losses from climate-related disasters are in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
        This is not to mention the human impact of geo-physical disasters, which are 91 percent climate-related, and
        which between 1998 and 2017 killed 1.3 million people, and left 4.4 billion injured. The goal aims to mobilize
        US$100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries to both adapt to climate change and
        invest in low-carbon development.
        <br><br>
        Supporting vulnerable regions will directly contribute not only to Goal 13 but also to the other SDGs. These
        actions must also go hand in hand with efforts to integrate disaster risk measures, sustainable natural resource
        management, and human security into national development strategies. It is still possible, with strong political
        will, increased investment, and using existing technology, to limit the increase in global mean temperature to
        two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, aiming at 1.5Â°C, but this requires urgent and ambitious
        collective action.

        Goal Targets -
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all
            countries</li>
        <li>Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning</li>
        <li>Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation,
            adaptation, impact reduction and early warning</li>
        <li>Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
            on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address
            the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on
            implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as
            possible</li>
        <li>Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in
            least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local
            and marginalized communities</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
