    <h2>Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life provides 80
        percent of the human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resources. Forests cover 30
        percent of the Earthâ€™s surface, provide vital habitats for millions of species, and important sources for clean
        air and water, as well as being crucial for combating climate change.
        <br><br>
        Every year, 13 million hectares of forests are lost, while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the
        desertification of 3.6 billion hectares, disproportionately affecting poor communities.
        <br><br>
        While 15 percent of land is protected, biodiversity is still at risk. Nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants
        have been illegally traded. Wildlife trafficking not only erodes biodiversity, but creates insecurity, fuels
        conflict, and feeds corruption.
        <br><br>
        Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity which are part of our common
        heritage and support global food and water security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and peace and
        security.

        Goal Targets -
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater
            ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with
            obligations under international agreements</li>
        <li>By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation,
            restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally</li>
        <li>By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification,
            drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world</li>
        <li>By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance
            their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development</li>
        <li>Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of
            biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species</li>
        <li>Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and
            gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions
        </li>
        <li>Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and
            promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed</li>
        <li>Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both
            demand and supply of illegal wildlife products</li>
        <li>By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive
            alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species</li>
        <li>By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development
            processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts</li>
        <li>Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use
            biodiversity and ecosystems</li>
        <li>Mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest management
            and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance such management, including for
            conservation and reforestation</li>
        <li>Enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected species, including by
            increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities</li>
    </ul>
