    <h2>The number of undernourished people has dropped by almost half in the past two decades because of rapid economic
        growth and increased agricultural productivity. Many developing countries that used to suffer from famine and
        hunger can now meet their nutritional needs. Central and East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have all
        made huge progress in eradicating extreme hunger.
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. There are
        821 million people estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2017, often as a direct consequence of
        environmental degradation, drought and biodiversity loss. Over 90 million children under five are dangerously
        underweight. Undernourishment and severe food insecurity appear to be increasing in almost all regions of
        Africa, as well as in South America.

        Goal Targets -
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on
            stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent
            girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons</li>
        <li>By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular
            women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal
            access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and
            opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment</li>
        <li>By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that
            increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation
            to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve
            land and soil quality</li>
        <li>By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and
            their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the
            national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of
            benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as
            internationally agreed</li>
        <li>Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure,
            agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in
            order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed
            countries
        </li>
        <li>Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the
            parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent
            effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round
        </li>
        <li>Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and
            facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme
            food price volatility.</li>
    </ul>
