    <h2>We cannot hope for sustainable development without peace, stability, human rights and effective governance,
        based on the rule of law. Yet our world is increasingly divided. Some regions enjoy peace, security and
        prosperity, while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is not inevitable and
        must be addressed.
        <br><br>
        Armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a countryâ€™s development, affecting economic growth,
        and often resulting in grievances that last for generations. Sexual violence, crime, exploitation and torture
        are also prevalent where there is conflict, or no rule of law, and countries must take measures to protect those
        who are most at risk
        <br><br>
        The SDGs aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence, and work with governments and communities to end
        conflict and insecurity. Promoting the rule of law and human rights are key to this process, as is reducing the
        flow of illicit arms and strengthening the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global
        governance.
