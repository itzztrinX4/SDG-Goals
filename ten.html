    <h2>Income inequality is on the rise—the richest 10 percent have up to 40 percent of global income whereas the
        poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 to 7 percent. If we take into account population growth inequality in
        developing countries, inequality has increased by 11 percent.
        <br><br>
        Income inequality has increased in nearly everywhere in recent decades, but at different speeds. It’s lowest in
        Europe and highest in the Middle East.
        <br><br>
        These widening disparities require sound policies to empower lower income earners, and promote economic
        inclusion of all regardless of sex, race or ethnicity.
        <br><br>
        Income inequality requires global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of financial
        markets and institutions, encouraging development assistance and foreign direct investment to regions where the
        need is greatest. Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also key to bridging the widening
        divide.
